# Chapter 1 - Day 2 - The Flow Blockchain & Cadence

## 1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

1. **Safety and Security**: An execution of smart contract is of concern of user's money, so the safety and security is the first thing of the programming language. Cadence is designed to be a strong static type system that developers could identify bugs at the early stage of development. This design could effectively improve the safety and security of smart contract.
2. **Clarity**: Cadence is very easy to read as users can audit the saffety of smart contract by theirselves.
3. **Approachability**: The written of Cadence is similar to other program language which any experienced developers could be very easy to get started.
4. **Developer Experience**: Debugging is sometimes agony for developers. The error message in Cadence is very clear for debugging.
5. **Resource Oriented Programming**: Cadence is a resource oriented programming language that allows assets on Flow chain record on the user's address, not like Ethereum, tokens are stored in a contract that record the status of the token.

## 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

These pillars could be referenced for every project or product. As a user of a product, the most crucial thing is that if it is safe to use. Secondly, if the instruction of product is clarity enough or easy to operate. For the developer, is it easy to maintain the product is important.
