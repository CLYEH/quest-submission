## Chapter 1 - Day 1 - Learning Blockchain Concepts

### 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp

A blockchain is a decentralized database which is accessable and open to all. The data on the blockchain is stored distributed in every node on the computer network and each node stores the same copy of the data which means there is no central authority to manage the data. Once the data has been recorded on chain, the data only changed if the owner approves to. The mechanism of it is that blockchain technology uses a cryptography method of public key and private key which only allows the corresponding private key to access the data. So as the owner keeps his key safe, it is nearly impossible to undone any of his data by any others.  

### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts

A smart contract is a series of code that could be deployed by anyone on the blockchain. The contract can be called by any user to execute the specific action on chain, which could take paramaters input by users, record any valid data on the chain and will update the data to every node.
  
### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

- A **script** is used to view blockchain data which does not change any status on chain and doesn't cost money.
- A **transaction** is a function call that could change the data on chain and requires fee.
